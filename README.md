# What Is Image Classification?
Image classification is the task of assigning a label or class to an entire image. Images are expected to have only one class for each image.



# Study Area
For this purpose, an image with the number of 183 bands and image dimensions of 398x918 taken by the ROSIS sensor from the University of Pavia located in the south of Italy has been considered.
The study area in this exercise generally includes 5 classes.Below is the image of the study area with its labels.

# METHODOLOGY
# 1.svm 
SVM is a powerful supervised algorithm that works best on smaller datasets but on complex ones. Support Vector Machine, abbreviated as SVM can be used for both regression and classification tasks, but generally, they work best in classification problems.

# 2.ML
Maximum likelihood classification assumes that the statistics for each class in each band are normally distributed and calculates the probability that a given pixel belongs to a specific class. Unless you select a probability threshold, all pixels are classified.

# 3.KNN
The k-nearest neighbors algorithm, also known as KNN or k-NN, is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.

For image classification with different algorithms, we need training and test data.The algorithm is trained with the training data and finally the accuracy of the algorithm is determined with the test data.The result of classified images for each algorithm is shown.
